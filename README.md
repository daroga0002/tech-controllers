This is an integration of heating controllers from Polish company TECH Sterowniki Sp. z o.o. It uses [API](https://api-documentation.emodul.eu/) to their web control application eModul.eu, therefore your controller needs to be accessible from the Internet and you need an account either on <https://emodul.eu> or <https://emodul.pl>.

The integration is based on API provided by TECH which supports the [list of compatible controllers](https://github.com/mariusz-ostoja-swierczynski/tech-controllers?tab=readme-ov-file#rocket-list-of-reported-working-tech-controllers)

The integration was developed and tested against eModul demo account (username: `test`/password: `test`) which features 4 controllers:

- I-3
- L-8
- Pellet
- Solar

and community reported controllers.

> [!WARNING]
> Everything else might or might not work - needs community help, testing and reporting back what works. Check below for reported working controllers.

## :sparkles: Features

- Configuration through UI
- Support for multiple controllers which can be individually imported under given single account
- Provides Climate entities representing zones
  - and their corresponding Temperature, Battery, Humidity sensors, Window sensors when available
- Climate entities display data through Thermostat card
- Provides sensors for eModul 'tiles'
- Automatic naming and translations of tiles from eModul API
- Supporting languages which are supported by eModul API

**This integration will set up the following platforms.**

Platform | Description
-- | --
`binary_sensor` | Show info and status from Tech API.
`sensor` | Show info and status from Tech API.
